This repository includes the writing report of the analytical solution ('ReportBI_MAA.pdf'), the reports made in PowerBI Desktop and finally the dashboard was made in the PowerBI online portal.
The data used in this project is from the Microsoft's fictional multidimensional database 'WideWorldImporters', where called 'WWIMS'.
My group also extracted data from the facebook and twitter. Twitter's data were extracted using API in R, all the procedure is described in the report.
